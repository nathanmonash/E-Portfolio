Hey there people,

I'm here to tell you what I like to do in a professional way! What do you guys think? I am going back to school at UBC right now for a Master's of Geomatics. I have experience in Air Quality Consulting, but I'm open to try other types of employment in the field. I love my dog Bennie Jett!
